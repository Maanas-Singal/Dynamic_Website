# Dynamic_Website
## Creating a dynamic webpage that displays a positive thought as a message can be achieved using Python with the Flask web framework. 
## We'll also use HTML and CSS to design the frontend. 
## The positive thoughts will be stored in a list, and the webpage will randomly pick one to display each time it's refreshed.
### Here's the step-by-step implementation:

# Install Flask, and make sure you have Python installed, and then install Flask using the following command:
$ pip install Flask

# Save both the Python script (app.py) and the HTML template (index.html) in the same directory.
# Run the application: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the Python script, and run the following command:
$ python App.py

# Access the webpage: Open your web browser and go to the following URL:
$ http://"Some_IP_Address":5000/
# http://"Some IP Address":"Port Number"/

### Each time you refresh the webpage or click the "Get Another Positive Thought" button, a random positive thought will be displayed on the webpage. 
### The user interface will be simple, showing the positive thought as a message, and the user can get a new thought by clicking the button.
